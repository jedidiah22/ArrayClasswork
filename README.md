# ArrayClasswork

step 1
# Input: An array 'a' of 'n' integers and an integer 'd' representing the number of left rotations.

step 2
# Normalize the rotations: Since rotating the array 'n' times results in the same array, we can reduce the number of rotations to 'd' % 'n'.

step 3
# Compute the result:
   -Split the array into two parts: the first 'd' elements and the rest of the array.
   -Concatenate the two parts in reversed order.
